Import tt_news and tx_comments from TYPO3 into WordPress.

== Description ==
Importer to bring your TYPO3 news and their related media and comments into WordPress.

Requires remote web and database access to the source TYPO3 instance. Images, files and comments related to TYPO3 tt_news entries will be pulled into WordPress as new posts.

Comments will be automatically tested for spam via Askimet if you have it configured.

Inline and related images will be added to the Media Library. The first image found will be set as the Featured Image for the post. Inline images will have their source URLs updated. Related images will be converted to a [gallery] and appended or inserted into the post per your settings.

Files will be appended to post content as 'Related Files'.

It's possible to change post statuses on import. However, draft posts, will remain as drafts.

If you import TYPO3 news and they've gone live when you didn't want them to, visit the Options screen and look for `Oops`. That's the option to convert imported posts to `Private` thereby removing them from public view.

Finally, it's possible to delete prior imports and lost comments and attachments.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `typo3-importer` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
