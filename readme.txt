TYPO3 Importer by Aihrus easily imports thousands of tt_news and tx_comments from TYPO3 into WordPress.

== Description ==

TYPO3 Importer [by Aihrus](http://aihr.us/about-aihrus/) brings your TYPO3 news, related media and comments into WordPress with minimal fuss. You can be as selective or open as you'd like for selecting which tt_news records to grab. Import can be interrupted and restarted later on.

Inline and related images will be added to the Media Library. The first image found is optionally set as the Featured Image for the post. Inline images will have their source URLs updated. If there's more than one related image, the [gallery] shortcode is optionally inserted into the post.

* Requires remote web and database access to the source TYPO3 instance.
* Comments will be tested for spam via Askimet if you have Askimet configured.
* Files and links will be appended to post content with optional shortcode wrappers, like [member]|[/member].  
* Post status override is possible, but hidden posts, will be set as Drafts.
* Opps and Restore options provide quick clean up and hiding of imports.

= Filter Options =

* `t3i_prepare_content` - Modify `tt_news.bodytext` before import
	* Example: See `fpjq_t3i_prepare_content` at bottom of `typo3-import.php`
